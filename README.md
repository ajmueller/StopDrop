# StopDrop
A time-tracking app that uses Dropbox's datastore API for syncing your data across devices.
https://stopdrop.azurewebsites.net/

## How to Use
1. Launch the site and if you haven't authenticated the app with Dropbox's datastore API, you will be prompted to do so.
2. Click/tap "New" to create a new watch.  Depending on your settings at the bottom of the app, the watch may stop any other actively tracking watches and it may begin automatically tracking time.
3. Double-click/tap in empty space of a watch to expand it and see additional options to add notes, change its color, delete it, reset it, or increase or decrease its time.
4. Single-click on the watch name to rename it. **NOTE** this feature does not currently work on touch screens.

# DEPRECATION NOTICE:
Dropbox has deprecated the datastore API, so as of April 2016, this application will no longer be functional.  [Read more about the API deprecation](https://blogs.dropbox.com/developers/2015/04/deprecating-the-sync-and-datastore-apis/) on their developer blog.
